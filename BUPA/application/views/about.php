  <p>On 15th February 2014 a special meeting was convened at the Railway Club for members to brainstorm on activities 
for the Investment Company. Among issues deliberated upon were the registration process of the Company, 
safeguarding individual investments, financial facilities available on the market to aid in the process of investment, 
and the setting up of an investment committee. The meeting resolved that all registered BUPA members be 
encouraged to make a minimum commitment of KES 100,000. Details of how to make this commitment may be 
obtained from the BUPA Committee. Focus was on putting up an office block and rental income units within Busia 
with matching funds from a commercial bank.</p>

opportunity. For further information on how to be
